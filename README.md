Dear readers,

This is the Repository for my Snow-Ball-Fight Minecraft plugin.
It is dependent on spigot/bukkit for its API.
You can find a compiled version where I posted it for download at: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/snow-ball-fight.9576/
This website hosts numerous player made Minecraft plugins, as well as the spigot API for minecraft servers.
I received over 450 downloads over the course of this plugin's lifespan, of which I am quite proud.
I have not tested this plugin on newer versions of Minecraft, but it likely needs to be updated to the current version of the bukkit/spigot API.

Sincerely,

ssscrazy
