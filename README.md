Dear readers,

General information about this project:

This is the Repository for my Snow-Ball-Fight Minecraft plugin.
It is dependent on spigot/bukkit for its API.
You can find a compiled version where I posted it for download at: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/snow-ball-fight.9576/
This website hosts numerous player made Minecraft plugins, as well as the spigot API for minecraft servers.
I received over 450 downloads over the course of this plugin's lifespan, of which I am quite proud.
I have not tested this plugin on newer versions of Minecraft, but it likely needs to be updated to the current version of the bukkit/spigot API.

A few notes about the code:

I recognize that the code is somewhat poorly organized, a result of my (at the time) poor coding ability. I first taught myself to program by making this plugin. Consequently, there may be redundant or inefficent code, strange syntax, or other peculiarities. I have filled the code with comments in order to better explain my thought process, organization, and what was happening in each block of code. I hope this will remove any potential confusion, but if something is unintelligible, feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

ssscrazy
